                    <h2>RestAssured</h2>
                    <p>
                        RestAssured is a popular Java library for testing RESTful APIs. It provides a simple and intuitive API for making HTTP requests and validating responses. Here's how you can learn RestAssured:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Official RestAssured documentation: <a href="https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured/wiki">https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured/wiki</a></li>
                        <li>Online tutorials and courses: Udemy's "REST API Automation With RestAssured - Novice To Ninja" by Rahul Shetty</li>
                        <li>Practice by writing test scripts for different RESTful APIs</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>JUnit</h2>
                    <p>
                        JUnit is a widely used testing framework for Java applications. It provides a set of annotations and assertions to write and execute unit tests. Here's how you can learn JUnit:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Official JUnit documentation: <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/">https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/</a></li>
                        <li>Online tutorials and courses: Udemy's "JUnit 5: Crash Course" by John Thompson</li>
                        <li>Practice by writing unit tests for Java classes and methods</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Selenium</h2>
                    <p>
                        Selenium is a powerful tool for automating web browsers. It allows you to interact with web elements, perform actions, and validate web application behavior. Here's how you can learn Selenium:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Official Selenium documentation: <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/">https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/</a></li>
                        <li>Online tutorials and courses: Udemy's "Selenium WebDriver with Java - Basics to Advanced&Framework" by Raghav Pal</li>
                        <li>Practice by automating web tests for different web applications</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Intermediate and Advanced Concepts</h2>
                    <p>
                        Once you have a good understanding of Java, RestAssured, JUnit, and Selenium, you can explore more advanced topics to become a Senior Test Automation Engineer. Some areas to focus on include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Design patterns for test automation, such as Page Object Model (POM) or Screenplay pattern</li>
                        <li>Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for running automated tests</li>
                        <li>API testing best practices, including authentication, request/response validation, and performance testing</li>
                        <li>Advanced Selenium features like handling dynamic elements, working with iframes, or using headless browsers</li>
                        <li>Integration with other testing frameworks or tools, such as Cucumber, TestNG, or Jenkins</li>
                    </ul>
