                <h2>Introduction to DevOps</h2>
                <p>
                    DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to
                    improve collaboration and streamline the software delivery process. Start by understanding the core
                    principles and concepts of DevOps:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Read "The Phoenix Project" by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford</li>
                    <li>Explore online resources and tutorials on DevOps fundamentals</li>
                    <li>Attend DevOps conferences and meetups to learn from industry experts</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Version Control Systems</h2>
                <p>
                    Version control is a critical aspect of DevOps. Familiarize yourself with popular version control
                    systems, such as Git, and learn how to manage source code effectively:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn Git basics: branching, merging, and resolving conflicts</li>
                    <li>Practice using Git commands through online tutorials and exercises</li>
                    <li>Collaborate on open-source projects or personal projects using Git</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)</h2>
                <p>
                    CI/CD is a crucial part of DevOps. Gain hands-on experience with tools and techniques for automating
                    the build, test, and deployment processes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learn about popular CI/CD tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitLab CI/CD</li>
                    <li>Build a simple CI/CD pipeline that includes source code compilation, testing, and deployment
                    </li>
                    <li>Explore advanced CI/CD concepts like infrastructure provisioning, containerization, and
                        orchestration
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</h2>
                <p>
                    IaC enables you to manage infrastructure resources programmatically. Learn how to define and
                    provision infrastructure using tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Study the basics of infrastructure provisioning and configuration management</li>
                    <li>Practice writing infrastructure code using Terraform or AWS CloudFormation</li>
                    <li>Automate the creation and management of cloud resources for your projects</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Monitoring and Logging</h2>
                <p>
                    Monitoring and logging are essential for maintaining the health and performance of software systems.
                    Familiarize yourself with monitoring tools and practices:
